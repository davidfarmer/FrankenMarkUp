Welcome to a sample of antePreTeXt.

\begin{definition}
A _group_ is a set $G$ along with a binary operation $dot$ such that:

  - The operation is associative: if $a,b,c in G$ then <m>a dot (b dot c) = (a dot b) dot c</m>.

  - There exists an _identity element_ $e in G$ such that $e dot a = a$ and $a dot e = a$ for all $a in G$.

  - For each $a in G$ there exists an _inverse_ element $b in G$ such that $a dot b = e$ and $b dot a = e$.
\end{definition}

To speak of a group one must refer to both the set and the operation.
The sentence "The integers are a group." is either incorrect or incomplete,
depending on your perspective.
A correct statement that is similar to that sentence is
'The integers are a group under addition.'
Any nonempty set can be made into a group by specifying an appropriate
operation -- don't fall into the trap of assuming the 'obvious'
operation is intended.  Say what you mean, and only use what is (explicitly) said.

Exercise:
Explain why the condition *nonempty* was included in the previous paragraph.

The idea of a group was introduced by the French mathematician \'Evariste Galois,
who used groups to answer the question:  when is there a nice formula for the
roots of a polynomial?  Most people know the quadratic formula.  There are
formulas for the roots of any cubic (degree~3) or degree~4 polynomial.
It turns out that some higher degree polynomials have nice formulas for their
roots, and some don't.  For example, there is an expression
(complicated, but only using familiar operations)
for the roots of <m>x^5 - 5 x^2 - 3</m>, but there is no such formula for the
roots of $x^5 - 5 x^2 + 3$.  Why should those two polynomials
behave so differently?

Galois figured out the answer.
He discovered that to each polynomial there can be associated a group,
known today as the "Galois group" of the polynomial.  Properties of that group,
which we will explore later, 
tell you whether there exists a nice formula for the roots.

Beyond questions about roots of polynomials,
why are groups important?  In particular, why are those three 
axioms natural?
We will answer that question by thinking about how to solve the
simplest possible equations.

\begin{exploration}
Suppose we want to solve the equation $a x = b$.  Thinking back to
when you first learned about solving equations, the main idea was:
do the same operation on both sides of the equals sign. 
First step, multiply on the left by $a^-1$:
$$
  a^-1 (a x) = a^-1 b .
$$
We have just encountered one of the axioms of a group: the existence of
an inverse.  
In the above equation ee included the parentheses to emphasize the fact that $a^-1$ is
multiplying the left side of the equation, which is the *quantity* $a x$.
Now we regroup (i.e., use associativity) to get
$$
    (a^-1 a) x = a^{-1} b .
$$
What does $a^-1 a$ equal?  By definition, it equals the identity,
which in the axioms for a group we have denoted~$e$:
$$
   e x = a^{-1} b .
$$
By definition of the identity, <m>e x = x</m>, so we obtain the solution $x = a^-1 b$.

We see that identity, inverse, and associativity are the
necessary ingredients to solve the simplest possible equations.
All those properties are necessary,
and
no other properties are needed.

The discussion above only used half of the identity axiom and
half of the inverse axiom.
The other halves are needed to solve the equation $x a = b$.
\end{exploration}

One of the group axioms said "there exists" an identity.  Does that
mean there can be more than one?  Same question for "there exists" an inverse.
In the exploration above we talked about $a x$ and also about $x a$.
Aren't those the same?  We will answer one of those questions and leave
the others as exercises.

Another issue is the binary operation in the definition of a
group.  In the exploration above there is no explicitly named
operation:  we merely juxtaposed symbols, as in $a x$, to indicate
that $a$ and $x$ are combined in some way.  What is the operation?
Is it addition? subtraction? multiplication? exponentiation?
The answer is that sometimes there is no answer.  The operation in a group
is just that: an operation -- a way of combining two objects.
It is not necessary to give an
explicit meaning to the operation:  just manipulate the
symbols using the axioms.  You will become more
comfortable with this perspective as you gain experience.

Aside:
The next exercise would occur much later in the exposition,
but this is a demonstration of antePreTeXt, not a real
textbook on group theory.

\begin{exercise}
The Hilbert Hotel has mattresses which are both symmetric and comfortable:
both sides can be used, and you can sleep with your feet pointing either
North or South.  (All the rooms have a window facing either East or West,
and the beds are oriented so that you can easily look at the sunrise or
sunset, if that is your preference.)

The manager is concerned that the mattresses are wearing out because
the housekeepers are not rotating them uniformly.  You have received
the following memo:

<blockquote>
To help the mattresses last longer, every month we rotate the mattresses.
I suspect that the staff is not keeping track of how they flip the mattresses,
and so parts of the mattress are being used excessively, causing it to
wear out too quickly.

Please devise a way to flip the mattress so that the same
operation can be done every time, and over the course of the year all
parts of the mattress will be used equally.  That way it is not
necessary for the staff to keep track of which way it was flipped previously.
</blockquote>

Write two responses to the manager's memo:  a one-sentence
reply which assumes the reader is familiar with the basic concepts of
group theory, and a longer reply which you think the manager might understand.

Hint:
The fact that a mattress is 3-dimensional is irrelevant:
model it as a rectangle.

Hint:
The manager has assumed that the group of symmetries of a rectangle
can be generated by a single element.  Is that assumption correct?
How many elements are in that group, and what are their orders?

\end{exercise}

<lemma>
The identity element of a group is unique.
</lemma>

<proof>
Suppose $e_1$ and $e_2$ are identity elements of a group $G$.  We have
$$
e_1 e_2 = e_1

=e_2
$$
Where the first equality uses the fact that $e_1$ is the identity and
the second equality uses the fact that $e_2$ is the identity.
Thus, $e_1 = e_2$.
</proof>

Note:
The above is not a good model to show students who are new to proofs,
but I needed a display equation with multiple lines to check
if parsing was working properly.
