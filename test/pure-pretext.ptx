            This is a paragraph that has <term>terms</term>, <em>emphasis</em>, <alert>alerts</alert>, and even some <c>code()</c> in it.

            In <pretext /> you write math with <tag>m</tag> tags, like this: <m>\sin(x) = \cos(x + \frac{\pi}{2})</m>.  You can also write an math equation like this:
            <me>
                f(x) = \begin{cases}
                    x^2 \amp \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
                    -x^2 \amp \text{if } x \lt 0
                \end{cases}
            </me>
            
        </p>
